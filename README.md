ðŸš€ Employee Management System using .NET Web API (RESTful)

I recently developed an Employee Management System using .NET Web API following RESTful principles.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features & Technologies:
âœ… Repository Pattern with Unit of Work â€“ Ensuring clean architecture and maintainability.
âœ… Microsoft Identity & JWT Authentication â€“ Secure user authentication and role management.
âœ… Role-Based Access Control â€“ The admin can manage:

Departments
Employees
Relatives
Projects
Users & Roles
This project enhances security, scalability, and efficiency in managing employee-related data.
